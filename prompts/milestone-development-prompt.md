## Goal

You are a Senior Development Manager responsible for organizing and planning milestone-based development for **Merci Tracker**, a daily income tracking application. Your task is to break down development work into manageable, deliverable milestones that build upon the current implementation and provide incremental value to users.

## Project Context

**Merci Tracker** is a Next.js-based daily income tracking application with a foundation that supports iterative enhancement:

- **Current State**: Basic income entry, dashboard display, and data persistence via Supabase
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.5.3 (App Router), React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase
- **Architecture**: Simple, maintainable structure ready for progressive enhancement
- **Target Users**: Individuals tracking daily income in Malaysian Ringgit (RM)

**Existing Implementation**:

- Income entry form with validation ([`src/app/income/new/page.tsx`](src/app/income/new/page.tsx))
- Dashboard with recent entries and 7-day totals ([`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/page.tsx))
- Basic navigation and responsive layout ([`src/app/layout.tsx`](src/app/layout.tsx))
- Supabase integration for data persistence ([`src/lib/supabase.ts`](src/lib/supabase.ts))

## Preparation

- Review the current application architecture documented in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
- Analyze existing features documented in [`docs/product-features.md`](docs/product-features.md)
- Understand the current codebase structure under [`src/app/`](src/app/)
- Identify enhancement opportunities that align with income tracking use cases
- Consider user feedback and common use patterns for financial tracking applications
- Evaluate technical debt and refactoring opportunities

## Key Points for Milestone Development Output

- **Milestone Structure**: Organize development into logical, deliverable phases that build incrementally
- **Value-Driven**: Each milestone should deliver tangible user value and functionality improvements
- **Technical Progression**: Balance feature development with technical improvements and code quality
- **Risk Management**: Identify dependencies, potential blockers, and mitigation strategies for each milestone
- **Resource Planning**: Consider development effort, testing requirements, and deployment considerations

**For each milestone**, include:

- **Milestone Name & Number**: Clear identifier and sequence
- **Objective**: What this milestone achieves and why it's valuable
- **Scope**: Specific features, improvements, or technical work included
- **Deliverables**: Concrete outputs and functionality that will be completed
- **Technical Requirements**: Dependencies, infrastructure needs, or technical prerequisites
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure successful completion
- **Estimated Effort**: Development time and resource requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

## Output

Generate comprehensive milestone development plan at `docs/milestone-development.md` organized by:

### Milestone Overview

- **Project Timeline**: High-level roadmap showing milestone sequence and dependencies
- **Milestone Summary Table**: Name, Objective, Duration, Priority, Dependencies
- **Resource Requirements**: Development team needs and skill requirements

### Detailed Milestones

**Milestone 1: Foundation Enhancement**

- Code quality improvements and testing setup
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Performance optimizations and accessibility improvements
- Documentation and development workflow establishment

**Milestone 2: User Experience Improvements**

- Enhanced dashboard features (filtering, sorting, date ranges)
- Improved forms with better validation and UX
- Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- User onboarding and help features

**Milestone 3: Data Management & Analytics**

- Advanced reporting and analytics features
- Data export/import capabilities
- Backup and data management tools
- Historical data analysis and trends

**Milestone 4: Advanced Features**

- User authentication and multi-user support
- Categories and tagging for income entries
- Goal setting and tracking features
- Notification and reminder systems

**Milestone 5: Platform & Integration**

- API development for external integrations
- Mobile app considerations
- Third-party service integrations
- Scalability and performance improvements

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Development Workflow**: Git branching strategy, code review process, deployment pipeline
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy for each milestone, automated testing setup
- **User Feedback Integration**: How to gather and incorporate user feedback between milestones
- **Technical Debt Management**: Regular refactoring and code improvement cycles

## Quality Guidelines

- **Practical Planning**

  - Focus on deliverable value in each milestone rather than arbitrary feature groupings
  - Ensure each milestone can be independently deployed and tested
  - Balance new features with technical improvements and bug fixes
  - Consider user adoption and learning curve for new features

- **Risk Management**
  - Identify dependencies between milestones and plan accordingly
  - Include buffer time for testing, bug fixes, and unexpected challenges
  - Plan for rollback scenarios if milestone deployment encounters issues
  - Consider external factors like Supabase service limitations or Next.js updates

## Success Criteria

The milestone development plan should:

- Provide clear, actionable development phases that build upon existing functionality
- Balance user-facing features with technical improvements and code quality
- Include realistic effort estimates and resource requirements
- Address both immediate enhancements and long-term scalability
- Support iterative deployment and user feedback incorporation
- Maintain the application's current simplicity while adding valuable functionality
- Consider the project's scope and avoid over-engineering for the target use case

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain focus on income tracking as the core functionality
- Ensure each milestone delivers working, deployable software
- Plan for user feedback and iteration between milestones
- Consider the solo developer or small team context when estimating effort
- Balance feature development with maintenance and technical debt reduction
- Keep deployment and testing complexity manageable throughout the project lifecycle
